Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering can be described as the process by which code is written in any language in order to develop and maintain software systems to ensure their functionality. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it helps in the building of back end and front end softwares which ensure the smooth running of machines applications and technological components within the tech industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer :Emergence of the first digital computers: this occured in the early 1940s and 1950s as a need for structured development methodologies grew e.g the need to store information.
Answer: Emergence of coding languages: this occured as a in the 1970s as the need for structured programming arose and agile methodologies in the early 2000s
Answer:The rise of influential figures in the world of tech and software engineering who influenced the landscape through their methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Gathering information on user needs and system requirements
2. Creating detailed designs and architecture for software and user interfaces
3. Building the software using code with the design specifications from earlier.
4. Testing the code and software ensuring specifications were met
5. Releasing the software to users
6. Providing enhancements to the software

 Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: Waterfall methodology has a more sequential approach to software development while Agile methodology incorporates its focuse on flexibility and responding to change in software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - implements software solutions using code.
2. Quality assurance Engineer - Designs and executes testing plans for software.
3. Project Manager - Oversees software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. INtergrated Development Enviroments (IDEs) - provide tools for testing and writing code such tools include visual studio
2. Version Control Systems (VCS) - Provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordineting work around individuals such tools include Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Tight deadlines to produce a finished software - this can be solved through proper time management to avoid rushing through step required hence errors in the software
2.Buggs in code - solved by debugging systems in ur code
3.Changing requirements and needs from your code and users - this can be solved by taking a more flexible approach by using Agile methodology project type to your project

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing - Tests individual components of ones software.
2.Intergratrion testing - Tests interactions between different system components.
3.System testing - Tests the software as a whole.
4.Acceptance testing - Tests the software against user requirements to ensure it has met their needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer: Prompt Engineering entails a set of commands given to AI models to perform a certain task

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:Generate for me a workout routine.
Clear prompt: Generate for me a strength training workout routine for the week from monday to friday(no rest days included)
